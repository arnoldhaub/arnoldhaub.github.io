		<h2>More about myself.</h2>
	
		<p>I am currently following a training to become a <strong>web developper</strong> at <strong>BeCode</strong>, in the center of Brussels.</p>
	
		<p>Before starting this training, I did a <strong>bachelor degree</strong> in <strong>eBusiness</strong>. I did not like working as a marketer which made me think a lot about what I really wanted to do with my life. 
			After a long time relfection, I realized that I have always been attracted to code. <b>Solving problems</b>, <b>creating projects</b>, and <b>constantly learning</b> are things I like to do on a daily basis and that is, 
			in a certain way, what a developper does in his job. It became clear to me that I <b>wanted to try</b> and <b>see where it could take me</b>, and here I am.</p>

		<p>Outside of coding, I love to <b>write</b> and <b>read</b>. I have always been a dreamer, and writing and reading help me <b>develop my imagination</b> and <b>create stories</b>. 
			I love the process of <b>having an idea</b> in my head and trying to <b>bring it to life</b> by writing it down and letting my inspiration do the rest of the work. I created an instagram page and a website using WordPress to share my work. 
			When I first started, I only posted texts, now I am reading and recording them for people that does not like to read but prefer to listen.</p>
